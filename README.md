# Invesment management with python and machine learning

This is a repository with useful notebooks for investment management with python.

The notebooks are organized in lab sessions and specific topics, which you may find useful, I hope.
 
# Credits

The notebooks, modules and datasets are heavily based on EDHEC's "Invesment Management with python and machine learning", so all credit towards the authors of the course and EDHEC Business School. I just worked on the notebooks as I progressed through the specialization and saw a good opportunity to share what I've learned along the way.
